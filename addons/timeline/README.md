#### Timeline scale

Width and height of timeline video will be changed to this amount. Default value is recommended for 4K video.

#### Timeline quality

Quality of timeline video(lower is better). The range is exponential, so increasing the value +1 results in half the file size, while -1 results in double the file size.

#### Timeline frames per minute

The maximum frame rate is camera dependent, usually 6 or 15 FPM.
